# ECS Framework
This repo contains a simple Entity-Component-System framework originally developed for my old Turbo Engine project. The code here has been heavily modified (mainly in the removal of engine-specific types) and cleaned up so that it may act as an example of my work.

## Requirements
This framework was developed using C++17, and has not been tested on any older standards.

## Usage
The World and System types act as the interface for the framework. The bottom of world.hpp and system.hpp contain examples of their usage.
